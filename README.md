By Harrison, Andrew, and Sitara

## Project Summary
We would like to investigate *How different variants of Adaboost perform on different types of noise*. We plan on implementing different boosting algorithms (Adaboost, Brownboost, Logitboost, Savageboost) in which we will add different kinds of generated noise (No noise, Uniform, 1/x^2, Gaussian (e^(-x^2)), ?exponential (e^(-\lambda x)), Gaussian not centered at 0).
